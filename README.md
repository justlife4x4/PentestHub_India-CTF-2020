## Way 1:
First lets go to the page src code and see we get a pastebin link

Lets go the link and see the src code carefully

There you go our secret  ```UlU5Q1JDNDNhV2R4TkRzeGFXdGlOVEZwWWs5UE1EczZOREZT```
As many people couldnt solve it ..a hint was released ..it was ```2 * (70-6)```
It means 2 times base64 ...after decoding it with base64 for 2 times we get something like this 
```EOBD.7igq4;1ikb51ibOO0;:41R```
After doing some research on google we find a hint that its XOR encoded i.e. ```'E' ^ 'F' = 0x03```
So here i used a bit of python to decrypt the flag 
## Code:
```
>>> text1 = 'EOBD.7igq4;1ikb51ibOO0;:41R'
>>> for i in text 1: text1 = text1 + chr(ord(i) ^ 3)
>>> print(text1)

Output is : EOBD.7igq4;1ikb51ibOO0;:41RFLAG-4jdr782jha62jaLL38972Q
```
We can clearly see the flag i.e. `FLAG-4jdr782jha62jaLL38972Q`
Thats it.
