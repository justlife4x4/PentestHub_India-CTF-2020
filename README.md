## Way 1:
First lets go to the page src code and see we get a pastebin link 
![](https://i.ibb.co/N6SD1ZD/1.jpg)

Lets go the link and see the src code carefully
![](https://i.ibb.co/ByhDcq7/2.jpg)

There you go our secret  `UlU5Q1JDNDNhV2R4TkRzeGFXdGlOVEZwWWs5UE1EczZOREZT`

As many people couldnt solve it ..a hint was released ..it was `2 * (70-6)`

It means 2 times base64 ...after decoding it with base64 for 2 times we get something like this 

`EOBD.7igq4;1ikb51ibOO0;:41R`

After doing some research on google we find a hint that its XOR encoded i.e. 

![](https://i.ibb.co/QDGsYFs/cor.jpg)

`'E' ^ 'F' = 0x03`


So here i used a bit of python to decrypt the flag 


## Code:

```
text1 = 'EOBD.7igq4;1ikb51ibOO0;:41R'

for i in text1: text1 = text1 + chr(ord(i) ^ 3)
    
print(text1)
```

We can clearly see the flag i.e. `FLAG-4jdr782jha62jaLL38972Q`

Thats it.

## Way 2:
Most of you has seen this image and the link posted in facebook:

![](https://i.ibb.co/Q96GLYh/hosted-image.jpg)

## Alternative link: (that link became void)
`https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uYhkeNirbfoNUC2Wtd3STnCHC5C2uUZK/view`

Download that image and crack it with stegcrack

`https://github.com/Paradoxis/StegCracker`

![](https://i.ibb.co/1XKW7T3/Screenshot-20200616-153556.png)

See the string `RU9CRC43aWdxNDsxaWtiNTFpYk9PMDs6NDFS`

Decode it with base64 and again we get the samething as above in WAY 1: i.e. `EOBD.7igq4;1ikb51ibOO0;:41R`

Again follow the same steps in Way 1 and get the flag 

`FLAG-4jdr782jha62jaLL38972Q`
